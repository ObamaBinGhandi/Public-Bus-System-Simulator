In this project I will build a program that performs a discrete-time simulation of a simple public bus system.

My program will simulate a single bus that runs on a simple bus route. The program will also smulate passengers 
arriving at bus stops, waiting for the bus to home by, boarding the bus, and then finally getting off at their 
final destination. At the end of the simulation, my program will output the average passenger throughput, and the 
average waiting and transit times of passengers. 

My program will also output a log file that shows the activity of the bus and passengers throughout the system.
